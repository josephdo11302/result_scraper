"This sample was analyzed by elemental analysis using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the identification of heavymetal constituents.  External calibration curves for heavy metals were used for quantitation, with an additional internal reference standard.Resulting data was compared with a sample blank.",,,,,,,,
